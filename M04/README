1. Develop a geometric shapes class hierarchy - Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangle. 
Classes should describe the properties of a shape and have methods for calculating 
the area and perimeter of the shape. 
(A task with an emphasis on building an inheritance hierarchy, without unduly detailed implementation).

2. Implement a billet for a vector graphics editor. 
The full version of the editor should allow to create and print such figures as a 
line, circumference, rectangle, circle, triangle. 
This billet (just to make things easier) should be a console application, which allow:

•	Create a figure of chosen type with arbitrary coordinates
•	Print these figures to the console (type figures types and all of their parameters)

3. Create a class hierarchy and implement key methods for a computer game (no functional requirements yet). 
Game's plot:

•	A player can move within a rectangular field with size Width * Height
•	There are some bonuses on the fiels (apples, cherries, bananas) 
	which could be picked up by a player and give them score points
•	There are some monsters (wolves, bears) hunting the player and move using an algoritm
•	There are some obstacles on the field (stones, trees) which player and monster should avoid
•	The goal is to collect all bonuses and don't be eaten by monsters
