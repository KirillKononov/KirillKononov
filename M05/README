1. Create a console application (UI).

2. Create a class library that allows to convert a string to an integer number.
   Do not use Parse, TryParse, Convert etc.

3. Console application should only bring the input to that library and print output.

4. All of the exceptions should be handled properly in the library and 
   should be retrown to console application.

5. Try to provide the user with details (what's happened, why they're getting an error).

6. Log every step of the application usage 
   (application started, user made a request, responce was returned,
    application catched an error, application was shut down, etc).
