Task1:

Create a console application called "Students".
Create a class "Student" which includes string Name and string Email (name is like Name Surname, email is like name.surname@epam.com).
Create a constructor for this class, which takes 2 parameters - Name and Email. Make sure that email matches the name.
Create a constuctor for this class, which takes only Email. This constructor should refer to previous one
(you can get the name from the email).
In the main method create a string array "subjects" which contains 4 different shcool subjects ("Maths, "PE", etc..).
In the main method create 3 students with different names using first constructor


(like student1c1 = new Student { "Vasya Pupkin", "vasya.pupkin@epam.com" }, ...)


In the main method create 3 students with the same names names using second constructor


(like student1c2 = new Student { "vasya.pupkin@epam.com" }, ...)


Overall you should have 3 unique students (but there are 2 instances of each student)
Create a new empty dictionary of <Student, HashSet> called "studentSubjectDict".
For each student (remebmer that we got 6 variables despite there are only 3 unique students) fill in the dictionary like


studentSubjectDict[student1c1] = %3 random values from the subject array%
studentSubjectDict[student2c1] = %3 random values from the subject array%
studentSubjectDict[student3c1] = %3 random values from the subject array%
studentSubjectDict[student1c2] = %3 random values from the subject array%
studentSubjectDict[student2c2] = %3 random values from the subject array%
studentSubjectDict[student3c2] = %3 random values from the subject array%


Make sure that after that there are only three records in the "studentSubjectDict" dictionary
(for that purpose you should override Equals() and GetHashCode() for students class).

Task2:
Goal of the task is to get acquainted with Array.Sort, Stopwatch and System.Diagnostics.Process.

Create a console application called "Performance".
Create a class "C" with just one int field called "i".
Create a struct "S" with just one int field called "i".
In the main method create an array of 100000 "C" called "classes" and intialize it with random numbers.
In the main method create an array of 100000 "S" called "structs" and intialize it with random numbers.
Calculate PrivateMemorySize64 delta before and after arrays initialization (for each array separately). Print the results to console.
Compare the difference between these deltas and print it to the console.
Execute Array.Sort< С >(classes) и Array.Sort< S >(structs). Print the execution time of each sort to the console.
