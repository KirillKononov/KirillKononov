1. Create a class library

2. Implement a BinarySearch generic method (do not use the type constraints).

3. Implement a method that returns IEnumerable of the Fibonacci's numbers using 
   the iterator block yield.
   
4. Develop a generic class-collection Queue that implements the basic operations for working 
   with the stucture data queue. 
   Implement the capability to iterate by collection by design pattern Iterator.
   
5. Develop a generic class-collection Stack that implements the basic operations for working 
   with the stucture data stack. 
   Implement the capability to iterate by collection by design pattern Iterator.
   
6. Develop a generic class-collection Set that implements the basic operations for working 
   with the stucture data set with the reference types elements. 
   Implement the capability to iterate by collection by block iterator yield.
   
7. Creata a console application which demonstrates the fucntionality of the class library.

8. Create anothed console application.

9. Implement a calculator which evaluates expressions in Reverse Polish notation.
   For example, expression 5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 - (which is equivalent to 5 + ((1 + 2) * 4) - 3 in normal notation)
   should evaluate to 14. Note, that for simplicity you may assume that there are always spaces 
   between numbers and operations, e.g. 1 3 + expression is valid, but 1 3+ isn't. 
   Empty expression should evaluate to 0. Valid operations are +, -, *, /.
